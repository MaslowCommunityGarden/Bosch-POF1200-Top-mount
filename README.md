# Bosch POF1200 Top mount

Bosch POF 1200 Z-axis kit 2.0
This is the new version of the kit to equip your Bosch POF 1200 (or 1400) with a z-axis.
The nut Mount is still 3d printed, but the top Mount is made on my Maslow.
It also includes a lead screw and nut, and all the screws necesarry to do the transformation.
If you use the ring kit, it is necesarry to cut off the handles, and a small metal piece, essentially making the router useless for anything else. (Detailed instructions will follow)

This kit is not directly orderable via the site, it is sold by a forum member (Dag83)
If you follow this link (https://www.paypal.me/Dag83/22.8) , you can pay him €22.8 via paypal. Leave your adress in the paypal comment (comma separated please) This includes €15 for the kit and €7.8 shipping for most of Europe. If you want a kit and you’re not from Europe, please contact @Dag83 in the forums.

Thanks to @Ned for the original idea
