# Bosch POF1200 Top mount

Bosch POF 1200 Z-axis kit 2.0

Been wondering which router to use for your maslow in europe? Try this one.  The router is quite cheap, and this kit makes it's z-axis moves very rigid and reliable.

This is the new version of the kit to equip your Bosch POF 1200 (or 1400) with a z-axis.
The nut Mount is still 3d printed, but the top Mount is made on my Maslow.

It also includes a lead screw and nut, and all the screws necesarry to do the transformation.

If you use the ring kit, it is necesarry to cut off the handles, and a small metal piece.


Thanks to @Ned for the original idea
